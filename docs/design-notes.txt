Job editing
================================================================================
When the user selects a particular job in the job summary dialog and edits it,
Pluto displays the Job edit dialog.

The Job edit dialog, consists of two panels:
a) The job summary panel - this panel contains the attribute common across all
   the jobs, for example - short name, start type, cron, upper time and lower
   time etc.
   
b) Job specific attribute panel - This panel respresents the user interface for
   job specific attributes. Each Job can optionally attach a specific editor
   to the edit panel. For example, the realtime intraday scrip value fetch job
   can have a custom job attribute editor to enable the user to select the
   set of scripts for which realtime intraday scrip values need to be downloaded.
