The NSE.DEV and NSE.PROD databases should be backed up at regular intervals. This 
document summarizes the steps that need to be taken to backup and restore the 
database.

BACKUP
=================================================================================
commands:
	pg_dump -U nse_prod NSE.PROD | gzip > c:\temp\NSE.PROD.MMDDYYYY.bak.gz
	pg_dump -U nse_dev  NSE.DEV  | gzip > c:\temp\NSE.DEV.MMDDYYYY.bak.gz

The generated files should be moved to an offline storage device immediately.
The MMDDYYYY in the above commands should be replaced with the backup date equivalents.


RESTORE
=================================================================================
Restoration is typically done when the database is corrupted or the database
needs to be installed on a fresh machine. Before restoration can be applied, the
following steps need to be taken.

If we are installing a fresh database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
a) Install Postgres database
b) Create users nse_prod and nse_dev (with appropriate passwords)
c) Create the NSE.DEV and NSE.PROD tables 

------ DB creation script for NSE.DEV --------------
CREATE DATABASE "NSE.DEV"
  WITH OWNER = nse_dev
       ENCODING = 'SQL_ASCII'
       TABLESPACE = pg_default;
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE "NSE.DEV" TO public;
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE "NSE.DEV" TO nse_dev;

------ DB creation script for NSE.PROD --------------
CREATE DATABASE "NSE.PROD"
  WITH OWNER = nse_prod
       ENCODING = 'SQL_ASCII'
       TABLESPACE = pg_default;
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE "NSE.PROD" TO public;
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE "NSE.PROD" TO nse_prod;


If we are repairing an existing database.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Either we need to drop the databases and treat the scenario for creating a fresh 
installation or we should drop all the objects in the database before proceeding.

Once we have completed the prerequisite steps. We need to identify the backup file
which will be restored. The file should be unzipped. Note that the unzipped file 
would be huge in size, and hence it's imperative that it should be done on a size
with enough space.

commands:
psql -d NSE.PROD -U nse_prod -f <location of NSE.PROD.MMDDYYYY.bak>
psql -d NSE.DEV  -U nse_dev  -f <location of NSE.DEV.MMDDYYYY.bak>
